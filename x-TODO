Figure out how get the Center Map Button to work on both MapScreen and MyTreesMapScreen

Complete update functionality

Display how far away user is from a Tree on MyTrees, MyTreeDetailScreen, ListScreen, ListItemDetailScreen. Wire up new state. 

Ensure the geolocator tracks location- i THINK it simply finds initial location.

Add error handling for Tree Location input. Primarily, ensure the inputted Tree is within a certain radius from user location. This is to ensure the Google Maps API didn't put the tree in some insanse spot as it's prone to do sometimes...

Make Tree Database display the trees closest to the users proximity on both the ListScreen and MapScreen.  I don't think this is necessary for the MyTrees / MyTreesMapScreen Perhaps limit to 50?

Upload picture functionality to be inputted on the AddATreeScreen and to be displayed on the ListItemDetailScreen / MyTreeDetailScreen. If no custom pic is provided, write function to display default pic based on the users "Type" input. If pear is in type user input, default pic to pear tree etc. 

Write comprehensive list of possible fruit trees. 

Customize pins - possibly 2 different kinds

Customize map

Think about adding profiles for users? 

If Profiles are added, think about the abiltiy to add comments to be displayed on ListItemDetailScreen???

Likely rebrand the whole thing.
