Figure out how get the Center Map Button to work on both MapScreen and MyTreesMapScreen

Add Key to distinguish between User added Trees, Database Trees and Verfified Trees.

Likely look into this optimising custom marker stuff if trees bog down the app.

Complete update functionality

If the user has not made any trees- make a rendered <View> saying "There are no trees" or something along those lines on MyTrees

Display how far away the tree is from the user on MyTrees, MyTreeDetailScreen, ListScreen, ListItemDetailScreen. Wire up new state. 

Change color of text button after state is set on AddATreeScreen

Ensure the geolocator tracks location- i THINK it simply finds initial location.

Bottom About Drawer scrolls too far up. 

Add error handling for Tree Location input. Primarily, ensure the inputted Tree is within a certain radius from user location. This is to ensure the Google Maps API didn't put the tree in some insanse spot as it's prone to do sometimes...

Make Tree Database display the trees closest to the users proximity on both the ListScreen and MapScreen.  I don't think this is necessary for the MyTrees / MyTreesMapScreen Perhaps limit to 50?

Upload picture functionality to be inputted on the AddATreeScreen and to be displayed on the ListItemDetailScreen / MyTreeDetailScreen. If no custom pic is provided, write function to display default pic based on the users "Type" input. If pear is in type user input, default pic to pear tree etc. 

Write comprehensive list of possible fruit trees. 

Customize pins - possibly 2 different kinds

Customize map

Need to render loading screen logic in places... too lazy to check which ones right now.

Think about adding profiles for users? 

Getting that "User is already signed in if you accidently hit login button twice". Way to eliminate


Likely rebrand the whole thing. 
- Fruit Tree Finder
- Free Fruit Finder (FFF)
- Take Your Pick
- Gleaning the Hood
- Fruit for All

Once decided, make logo

Fix status bar in accordance white / black according to a given screen's css

CSS the shit out of it

add maximum character input on Type and location modals
